#Sockets Plugin for Xamarin and Windows (PCL)

An abstraction over the socket helper classes of .NET and WinRT, providing a PCL-friendly socket library for projects targeting Xamarin iOS/Android/Forms, Xamarin.Mac/MonoMac, Windows Phone 8/8.1, Windows Store, and Windows Desktop. It allows you to write socket code in your PCL, simplifying cross-platform peer-to-peer communications significantly as well as enabling code sharing for many other use cases. 

This library utilises the "Bait and Switch" pattern, so must be installed via NuGet in _both_ the PCL and your native projects. 

Get it on NuGet: ````Install-Package rda.SocketsForPCL````

### Classes
The plugin currently provides the following socket abstractions:

Class|Description|.NET Abstraction|WinRT Abstraction
-----|-----------|:--------------:|:---------------:
**TcpSocketListener** | Bind to a port and accept TCP socket connections. | TcpListener | StreamSocketListener 
**TcpSocketClient** | Connect to a TCP endpoint with bi-directional communication. | TcpClient | StreamSocket
**UdpSocketReceiver** | Bind to a port and receive UDP messages. | UdpClient | DatagramSocket
**UdpSocketClient** | Send messages to arbitrary endpoints over UDP. | UdpClient | DatagramSocket
**UdpSocketMulticastClient** | Send and receive UDP messages within a multicast group. | UdpClient | DatagramSocket

Apart from the decisions made in order to merge the two APIs, the abstraction aims to be relatively unprescriptive. 
This means that there is little to no protection in the library against socket failures, reliablity, retry, and other considerations.
[sockethelpers-for-pcl](https://github.com/rdavisau/sockethelpers-for-pcl) is a longer term project with the aim of providing useful functionality around the base sockets-for-pcl classes, including hub-style communications, custom protocol helpers and support for typed messaging, and error handling/life cycle and reliability options. 

### Example Usage
````TcpSocketListener```` and ````TcpSocketClient```` each expose ````ReadStream```` and ````WriteStream```` 
properties of type ````System.IO.Stream```` for receiving and sending data. ````UdpReceiver````, ````UdpClient```` and ````UdpMulticastClient```` expose a ````MessageReceived```` event and a ````Send()```` method due to the nature of the transport and the underlying implementations.

##### A TCP listener
    var listenPort = 11000;
    var listener = new TcpSocketListener();
    
    // when we get connections, read bytes until we get -1 (eof)
    listener.ConnectionReceived += async (sender, args) => 
    {
      var client = args.SocketClient; 
      
      int nextByte = 0; 
      while (nextByte != -1)
      {
        // read from the 'ReadStream' property of the socket client to receive data
        nextByte = await Task.Run(()=> client.ReadStream.ReadByte());
        Debug.Write(nextByte);
      }
    };
    
    // bind to the listen port across all interfaces
    await listener.StartListeningAsync(listenPort);

##### A TCP client
    var address = "127.0.0.1";
    var port = 11000;
    var r = new Random(); 
    
    var client = new TcpSocketClient();
    await client.ConnectAsync(address, port);
    
    // we're connected!
    for (int i = 0; i<5; i++)
    {
      // write to the 'WriteStream' property of the socket client to send data
      var nextByte = (byte) r.Next(0,254);
      client.WriteStream.WriteByte(nextByte);
      await client.WriteStream.FlushAsync();
      
      // wait a little before sending the next bit of data
      await Task.Delay(TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(500)); 
    }
    
    await client.DisconnectAsync();
    
##### A UDP receiver
    var listenPort = 11011;
    var receiver = new UdpSocketReceiver();
    
    receiver.MessageReceived += (sender, args) =>
    {
      // get the remote endpoint details and convert the received data into a string
      var from = String.Format("{0}:{1}", args.RemoteAddress, args.RemotePort);
      var data = Encoding.UTF8.GetString(args.ByteData, 0, args.ByteData.Length);
      
      Debug.WriteLine("{0} - {1}", from, data);
    };
    
    // listen for udp traffic on listenPort
    await receiver.StartListeningAsync(listenPort);

##### A UDP client
    var port = 11011;
    var address = "127.0.0.1";
    
    var client = new UdpSocketClient();
    
    // convert our greeting message into a byte array
    var msg = "HELLO WORLD";
    var msgBytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(msg);
    
    // send to address:port, 
    // no guarantee that anyone is there 
    // or that the message is delivered.
    await client.SendToAsync(msgBytes, address, port);

##### A multicast UDP client
    
    var port = 11811;
    var address = "239.192.0.1"; // must be a valid multicast address
    
    // typical instantiation
    var receiver = new UdpSocketMulticastClient();
    receiver.TTL = 5;
    
    receiver.MessageReceived += (sender, args) =>
    {
      var from = String.Format("{0}:{1}", args.RemoteAddress, args.RemotePort);
      var data = Encoding.UTF8.GetString(args.ByteData, 0, args.ByteData.Length);
      
      Debug.WriteLine("{0} - {1}", from, data);
    };
    
    // join the multicast address:port
    await receiver.JoinMulticastGroupAsync(address, port);

    var msg = "HELLO MULTIVERSE";
    var msgBytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(msg);
    
    // send a message that will be received by all listening in
    // the same multicast group. 
    await receiver.SendMulticastAsync(msgBytes);

##### Binding to a specific interface
For a majority of mobile use cases, binding to all interfaces is a good approach. However, when working with multicast or on a machine with many interfaces, it may be useful to bind to a specific interface. The ````TcpSocketListener````, ````UdpSocketReceiver```` and ````UdpSocketMulitcastClient```` classes include an optional ````CommsInterface```` parameter on their listen/join methods, allowing them to be bound to a specific interface only. If this parameter is not specified, all interfaces will be bound. ````CommsInterface```` has a static method ````GetAllInterfacesAsync```` that can be used to enumerate the available interfaces.

    // retrieve the list of interfaces from the device
    var allInterfaces = await CommsInterface.GetAllInterfacesAsync();
    
    // get the first interface with an ip address
    var firstUsable = allInterfaces.FirstOrDefault(ci => ci.IsUsable);
    
    if (firstUsable == null)
        return; // no connected interfaces, too bad!
        
    var listener = new TcpSocketListener(); 
    await listener.StartListeningAsync(11000, firstUsable); 
    
    Console.WriteLine("Listening on interface with ip: {0}", firstUsable.IpAddress);

##### TLS Support
`TcpSocketClient` supports TLS connections (server certificate only). Pass `true` to the optional parameter `useTls` on `ConnectAsync` to enable secure communication. 

### Platform Considerations
 - Xamarin.Mac Unified and MonoMac should work out of the box. For Xamarin.Mac Classic projects, after installing sockets-for-pcl you must manually alter the `<HintPath>` entries for `Sockets.Plugin` and `Sockets.Plugin.Abstractions` in your .csproj file, to replace references to `net45` with `Xamarin.Mac.Classic`. Without this, code interacting with portions of the `System.Net` namespace not implemented in mono, including methods on some classes required by `CommsInterface`, will fail. 
 - On Windows Phone, you will require appropriate permissions in your app manifest. Depending on whether you are listening or sending, this could include a combination of ````privateNetworkClientServer````, ````internetClient```` and/or  ````internetClientServer```` capabilities. 
 - On Windows Phone/Store, there are restrictions regarding passing traffic over loopback between separate apps (i.e. no IPC) 
 - Binding to specific interfaces is not supported on Windows Phone 8.0 (8.1 is fine). All interfaces will be bound, even if a specific ````CommsInterface```` is provided. 

Additional 'higher level' features will likely end up in the [sockethelpers-for-pcl](https://github.com/rdavisau/sockethelpers-for-pcl) project mentioned earlier.
